 # SWOT Analysis
  Strength - Easy to perform Basic Mathematical Calculations.
  Weakness - As of now it can't perform complex Mathematical Calculations.
  Oppurtunity - It saves people time and it is very effective to use. Further  improvements can add more segments to make it better.
  Threat - More advanced calculators are already in the market which can also perform complex calculations very easily so entering in to that market is very tough
